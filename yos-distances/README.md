A rust crate for distance functions.


### Square Euclidean
For more details, see the wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance).

### Manhatann Distance
The distance between two vector is the sum of the differences of their cartesian coordinates.
For more details, see the wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry).

### Chebyshev Distance
The distance between vectors is the greatest of their differences along any coordinate dimension.
For more details, see the wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance).

### Levenshtein Distance
The minimum number of single character edits (ins, del, sub) required to change one word into another.
For more details, see the wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance).

### Hamming Distance
The minimum number of subs required to change one word into another.
For more details, see the wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance).

### Lee Distance
For more details, see the wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_distance).

### Sift3 Distance
Fast string distance algorithm. The higher the returned value, the more different the two words are. A value of 0.0 means both strings are equal.
